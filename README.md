# Web Development Project 6 - *NWeather Dashboard*

Submitted by: **Ariana Garcia**

This web app: **An interactive data dashboard built with React that visualizes real-time weather data from the Weatherbit API. Users can search and filter cities, view key statistics, and explore detailed weather information for each city through dynamic links. The app also features data visualizations showing temperature and humidity trends across major global cities.**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total
